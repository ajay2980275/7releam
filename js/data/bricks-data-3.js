    solution: "Initially, parts of the action plan, such as taking pauses, may not make sense to you, despite the research that says that it works. Faulty assumptions often lead to many poor decisions including doing what will help you get better. In this case, you need to probe the assumptions that underlie your thoughts and attitudes. Why does it not make sense for you and can you re-evaluate these assumptions. "
