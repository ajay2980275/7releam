             <h3 class="site-color">1. Introduction</h3>
             <p>
Welcome to Seven Realms Solutions! Your use of Seven Realms Solutions’ services, including the services Seven Realms Solutions makes available through its website, the Seven Realms Solutions mobile application, and any other software or services offered by Seven Realms Solutions in connection with any of those (the “Services”) is governed by these terms of use (the “Terms”), so please carefully read them before using the Services. For the purposes of these Terms, “we,” “our,” “us,” and “SRS” refer to Seven Realms Solutions Labs, Inc., the providers and operators of the Services.
</p>
             <p>In order to use the Services, you must first agree to these Terms. If you are using the Services on behalf of an organization, you are agreeing to these Terms for that organization and promising that you have the authority to bind that organization to these Terms. In that case, “you” and “your” will also refer to that organization, wherever possible.</p>
             <p>You must be over 13 years of age to use the Services, and children under the age of 13 cannot use or register for the Services. If you are over 13 years of age but are not yet of legal age to form a binding contract (in many jurisdictions, this age is 18), then you must get your parent or guardian to read these Terms and agree to them for you before you use the Services. If you are a parent or guardian and you provide your consent to your child’s registration with the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms with respect of your child’s use of the Services.</p>
             <p>You agree your purchases and/or use of the Services are not contingent on the delivery of any future functionality or features or dependent on any oral or written public comments made by SRS or any of its affiliates regarding future functionality or features.</p>
             <p>BY USING, DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, OR OTHERWISE ACCESSING THE SERVICES OR ANY MATERIALS INCLUDED IN OR WITH THE SERVICES, YOU HEREBY AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THESE TERMS, THEN YOU MAY NOT USE, DOWNLOAD, INSTALL, OR OTHERWISE ACCESS THE SERVICES.</p>
             
             
          <h3 class="site-color">2. Not Medical Advice</h3>   

             <p>You acknowledge and agree that the Services constitute, primarily, a personalized self-help system designed to help you improve your own mental health and well-being and to address anxiety issues, and that if you choose to utilize the Services you are solely responsible for deciding which of the suggested techniques you put into practice and how to apply those techniques. As such, you acknowledge that SRS is not a health care provider, and does not provide you with any medical advice.
</p>
             
             <p>
            Any advice or other materials provided through the Services are intended for general information purposes only. They are not intended to be relied upon and are not a substitute for professional medical advice based on your personal circumstances. Such advice and other materials are intended to support the relationship between you and your healthcare providers (as the case may be), and not replace it. We are not liable or responsible for any actions taken due to your having read or been told about such advice or other materials. In particular, to the fullest extent permitted by law, we give no representation or warranties about the accuracy, completeness, or suitability for any purpose of the advice or other materials and information published on or through the Services.
             </p>
             
             <p>
            If you receive advice from a doctor or other qualified medical professional which conflicts with anything contained in the Services then the former should take precedence. Never disregard professional medical advice or delay in seeking it because of something you have read through these Services. If you think you may have a medical emergency, call your doctor or 911 immediately. 
             </p>
              
             
              <h3  class="site-color">3. Use of Services by Medical Professionals</h3>   
             <p >In addition to functioning as a standalone personalized self-help system, the Services may also be used by certain medical professionals and/or health care providers (“Medical Professionals”) to monitor or otherwise assist in their patient’s use of the Services (“Patients”). Such use shall require the Patient’s affirmative consent, and shall also be subject to the terms of a separate agreement (the “Medical Professionals Agreement”), located at http://thinkSRS.com/medical_professionals_agreement.txt. In the event of any conflict between these Terms and the terms of the Medical Professionals Agreement, the terms of the Medical Professionals Agreement shall control with respect to use of the Services by Medical Professionals. In all other matters, these Terms shall control. </p>
              
            
             <h3 class="site-color">4. Your Account</h3>   
             <p>
In the course of registering for or using the Services, you may be required to provide SRS with certain information, including your name, email address, username and a password (“Credentials”). SRS handles such information with the utmost attention, care and security. Nonetheless, you, not SRS, shall be responsible for maintaining and protecting your Credentials in connection with the Services. If your contact information, or other information relating to your username or password changes, you must notify SRS promptly and keep such information current. You are solely responsible for any activity using your Credentials, whether or not you authorized that activity. You should immediately notify SRS of any unauthorized use of your Credentials or if your email or password has been hacked or stolen. If you discover that someone is using your Credentials without your consent, or you discover any other breach of security, you agree to notify SRS immediately.
</p>

             <p>SRS may refuse to store, provide, or otherwise maintain your User Content for any or no reason. SRS may remove your User Content from the Services at any time if you violate these Terms or if the Services are canceled or suspended. If User Content is stored using the Services with an expiration date, SRS may also delete the User Content as of that date. User Content that is deleted may be irretrievable. You agree that SRS has no responsibility or liability for the deletion or failure to store any User Content or other communications maintained or transmitted through use of the Services.</p>
             <p>SRS reserves the right (but shall have no obligation) to remove User Content from the Services, in its discretion.</p>

             </ul>
               <h3 class="site-color">6. Proprietary Rights</h3> 
             <p>

You acknowledge and agree that SRS (or SRS’s licensors) own all legal right, title and interest in and to the Services and that the Services are protected by copyrights, trademarks, patents, or other proprietary rights and laws (whether those rights happen to be registered or not, and wherever in the world those rights may exist).</p>
