    barrier: "I’m lazy",
    solution: " You may be okay with being lazy about keeping your environment orderly and clean without clutter. However, it is a much bigger hassle to become injured or ill as a result of the lack of safety in your environment. A few minutes to pick up is enough to be safe."

    barrier: "I like to drive fast",
    solution: "Driving fast can be exciting, but it does increase your risk of accidents.

"
},{
    barrier: "Always forget",

},{
    barrier: "Cleaning is boring",

},{
    barrier: "Driving slow is boring",
    solution: "You may be bored with driving slow and defensively but it becomes a much bigger hassle if you have an accident and become injured or injure someone else. Find other ways to enjoy driving such as listening to your favorite music. "
