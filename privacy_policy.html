             </p>
             
             <h3 class="site-color">1. Consent.</h3>
             <p>
By using the Services, you consent to the use of your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy. Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy, your Personal Information will not be used for any other purpose without your consent. We do not collect Personal Information for the purpose of sale of such information in a way that identifies the individual (i.e. we don’t sell customer lists). You may withdraw your consent to our processing of your Personal Information at any time. However, withdrawing consent may result in your inability to continue using some or all of the Services.
</p>
          <h3 class="site-color">2. Collection of Information.?</h3>   
<h4 class="site-color"> Personal Information</h4>
             <p>We will collect and store certain personal information from or about you in order to provide you with the Services. For example, when expressing an interest in obtaining additional information about the Services or registering to use the Services, we may require you to provide certain personally identifiable information, such as your name, company/organization name (if applicable), and email address. When purchasing the Services, we will require you to provide financial and billing information, such as billing name and address, and credit card number. Additionally, you may provide certain information to us in connection with your ongoing use of the Services, such as your health care provider’s name and contact information, mood tracking, thought diary entries, health habits, daily goals, and responses to behavioral health assessments. All of this information is collectively referred to as your “Personal Information.”
</p>
             <h4 class="site-color"> Data, Diagnostic & Login Information</h4>
             <p>
             You may be able to create, upload, publish, transmit, distribute, display, store or share information, data, text, graphics, video, messages or other materials using our Services (this is collectively referred to below as “Data”). Some of this Data may be stored and maintained on our servers. If you run into technical errors in the course of using the Services, we may request your permission to obtain a crash report along with certain logging information from your system documenting the error (“Diagnostic Information”). Such information may contain information regarding your Operating System version, hardware, browser version (and .NET version information in case of Windows systems), and your email address, if provided. Additionally, certain login information may be maintained in a cookie stored locally on your personal computing device (i.e. not on a server) in order to streamline the login process (“Login Information”).
             </p>
             <h4 class="site-color"> Apple’s Health App and the Apple HealthKit API</h4>
             <p>
             Certain features of the Services may actively record information about yourself as you use the Services. This tracking is accomplished through integration with Apple’s HealthKit API and the Apple Health App. Such information is referred to as “Apple Health Data.”
             </p>
              <h4 class="site-color"> Analytics Information</h4>
             <p>
             As you use our Services, we may also collect information through the use of commonly-used information-gathering tools, such as cookies, log files, and Web beacons. Such Information may include standard information regarding your mobile device, browser type, browser language, Operating System, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, and the actions you take on our web site (such as the web pages viewed and the links clicked) or while using the Services. Collectively, this information is referred to as “Analytics Information.”

             <h4 class="site-color"> Geo-Location</h4>

             </p>
              <h3  class="site-color">3. Use of Information.</h3>   
             <p class="site-color">We use the information we collect in the following ways:</p>
              <h4 class="site-color"> Personal Information</h4>
             <p>We use Personal Information to manage your account, to provide the Services, to maintain our customer/visitor lists, to respond to your inquiries or provide feedback, for identification and authentication purposes, for service improvement, and to address issues like malicious use of the Services. We may use Personal Information to communicate with you regarding the Services, including communications via email and push notifications. We may also use Personal Information for limited marketing purposes, namely, to contact you to further discuss your interest in the Services, and to send you information about us or our partners. We also use credit card information to manage your account, to provide the Services, and to check the financial qualifications of prospective customers and to collect payment for the Services. We may use a third-party service provider to manage credit card processing. If we do so, such a service provider will not be permitted to store, retain, or use Billing Information except for the sole purpose of credit card processing on our behalf.</p>
             <p>
             Any use of your Personal Information for these limited marketing purposes will comply with applicable federal and state laws, and, if applicable, any HIPAA Business Associate Agreement in place between SRS and your medical professional and/or health care provider (“Medical Professional”) who connects with you through the Services (see Section 8 of this Privacy Policy for more information regarding HIPAA).
             </p>
             <h4 class="site-color">Data, Diagnostic Information and Login Information</h4>
             <p>We use this information for the purpose of administering and improving our Services to you. We may also use this information in a de-identified, anonymous way in conjunction with an analytics service such as Google Analytics to monitor and analyze use of the Services, for the Services’ technical administration, to increase the Services’ functionality and user-friendliness, and for other legitimate business purposes.
</p>
              <h4 class="site-color">Apple Health Data</h4>
             <p>We use this information solely for the purpose of providing you with health-related feedback and self-care suggestions. This information is not used for advertising or other use-based data mining purposes. Your Apple Health Data is not accessible by other users of the Services and we will not share such information with third parties without your consent, except as provided in the sections below.</p>
              <h4 class="site-color">Analytics Information</h4>
             <p>We use this information to provide you with the Services. We may also use your Analytics Information in a de-identified, anonymous way in conjunction with an analytics service such as Google Analytics to monitor and analyze use of the Services, for the Services’ technical administration, to increase the Services’ functionality and user-friendliness, and to verify users have the authorization needed for the Services to process their requests.

</p>
             <p>If we plan to use your Personal Information in the future for any other purposes not identified above, we will only do so after informing you by updating this Privacy Policy. See further the section of this Privacy Policy entitled “Amendment of this Privacy Policy”. </p>
             <h3 class="site-color">4. Disclosures & Transfers.</h3>   
             <p>
We have put in place contractual and other organizational safeguards with our agents and contractors (see further below) to ensure a proper level of protection of your Personal Information (see further “Security” below). In addition to those measures, we will not disclose or transfer your Personal Information to third parties without your permission, except as specified in this Privacy Policy.
</p>
             <p>From time to time we may employ third parties as contractors to help us provide and/or improve the Services. These third parties may have limited access to Personal Information solely for the purpose of helping us to provide and/or improve the Services and they will be subject to contractual restrictions prohibiting them from using the information about our members for any other purpose. Such agents or third parties do not have any rights to use Personal Information beyond what is necessary to assist us. Wherever possible, these third parties will not be provided with access to your Apple Health Data.</p>
             <p>
             We may disclose your Personal Information to your Medical Professional who you connect with through the Services.
             </p>
             <p>We may also disclose your Personal Information with your consent.</p>
             
             <h3 class="site-color">5. Important Exceptions.</h3> 
             <p>
We may disclose your Personal Information to third parties without your consent if we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or property, other users of the Services, or anyone else (including the rights or property of anyone else) that could be harmed by such activities. We may disclose Personal Information when we believe in good faith that such disclosure is permitted or required by and in accordance with the law.
</p>
             <p>
             We may also disclose your Personal Information in connection with a corporate re-organization, a merger or amalgamation with another entity, a sale of all or a substantial portion of our assets or stock, including any due diligence exercise carried out in relation to the same, provided that the information disclosed continues to be used for the purposes permitted by this Privacy Policy by the entity acquiring the information.
             </p>
               <h3 class="site-color">6. Security.</h3> 
             <p>

The security of your Personal Information is important to us. We use commercially reasonable efforts to store and maintain your Personal Information in a secure environment. Communications between the mobile applications and our servers takes place over secure HTTPS connections and your data is encrypted when it is stored on our servers. We also use commercially reasonable technical, administrative, and physical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of the Personal Information that you provide to us. We have implemented procedures designed to limit the dissemination of your Personal Information to only such designated staff as are reasonably necessary to carry out the stated purposes we have communicated to you.</p>
             <p>You are also responsible for helping to protect the security of your Personal Information. For instance, never give out your password, and safeguard your user name, password and personal credentials when you are using the Services, so that other people will not have access to your Personal Information. Furthermore, you are responsible for maintaining the security of any personal computing device on which you utilize the Services.</p>
             <p>If we learn of a security breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. We may also post a notice on our website if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing.</p>
              <h3 class="site-color">7. Sharing Information with Third Parties.</h3> 
             <p>
             You may be able to share Personal Information with third parties through use of the Services. The privacy policies of these third parties are not under our control and may differ from ours. The use of any information that you may provide to any third parties will be governed by the privacy policy of such third party or by your independent agreement with such third party, as the case may be. If you have any doubts about the privacy of the information you are providing to a third party, we recommend that you contact that third party directly for more information or to review its privacy policy.
             </p>
              <h3 class="site-color">8. HIPAA</h3> 
             <p>If you connect with your Medical Professional through the Services, we are required to comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability of 1996, as amended, and its implementing regulations (collectively, “HIPAA”) as a “business associate” of your Medical Professional. We enter into a HIPAA Business Associate Agreement with each Medical Professional that is subject to HIPAA as a “covered entity.” We will comply with our HIPAA Business Associate Agreements and this Privacy Policy with respect to your Personal Information that is also “protected health information” as defined in HIPAA.</p>
              <h3 class="site-color">9. Retention.</h3> 
             <p>We will keep your Personal Information for as long as it remains necessary for the identified purpose or as required by law, which may extend beyond the termination of our relationship with you. We may retain certain data as necessary to prevent fraud or future abuse, or for legitimate business purposes, such as analysis of aggregated, de-identified data, or account recovery. All retained Personal Information will remain subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy. Please note that if you request that your Personal Information be removed from our databases, it may not be possible to completely delete all of your Personal Information due to technological, legal, or contractual constraints.</p>
             <h3 class="site-color">10. Amendment of this Privacy Policy.</h3> 
             <p>We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time. If we decide to change this Privacy Policy in the future, we will post or provide appropriate notice.

The date on which the latest update was made is indicated at the bottom of this document. We recommend that you print a copy of this Privacy Policy for your reference and revisit this policy from time to time to ensure you are aware of any changes. Your continued use of the Services signifies your acceptance of any changes.</p>
              <h3 class="site-color">11. Access and Accuracy.</h3> 
             <p>You have the right to access the Personal Information we hold about you in order to verify the Personal Information we have collected in respect to you and to have a general account of our uses of that information. Upon receipt of your written request, we will provide you with a copy of your Personal Information, although in certain limited circumstances we may not be able to make all relevant information available to you, such as where that information also pertains to another user. In such circumstances we will provide reasons for the denial to you upon request. We will endeavor to deal with all requests for access and modifications in a timely manner.</p>
             <p>We will make every reasonable effort to keep your Personal Information accurate and up-to-date, and we will provide you with mechanisms to update, correct, delete or add to your Personal Information as appropriate. This amended Personal Information will be transmitted to those parties to which we are permitted to disclose your information, as appropriate. Having accurate Personal Information about you enables us to give you the best possible service.
