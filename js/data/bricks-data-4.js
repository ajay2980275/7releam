    barrier: "Fear of change",
    solution: "Change is uncomfortable. Just thinking about change can provoke a negative emotional reaction. It is important to realize that change is the constant in our lives and we cannot avoid it. Thus, we always need to ensure that the change that will occur will be in a positive versus negative direction and can make our lives better as well as relieve or prevent pain."
},{
    barrier: "Fear of Failure",
    solution: "Not everyone can accept failure. We have a culture that rewards winners and thus many of us are afraid to take on something that may not work out or will be criticized.  Thus, these negative thoughts have made it difficult for us to take the risks that allow us to change.  To overcome this fear, it’s important to realize that change and failure is not fatal. Imperfection is a normal part of everyone’s life and should not be feared, particularly if the changes can make our lives better and relieve or prevent pain.   "
},{
    barrier: "Don't have time",
    solution: "Make creative activity, play, and fun a priority. Schedule it in as part of your routine. Do exercise as part of your daily activity such as taking the stairs or getting off the bus a stop early, if it is safe to do so. Set aside one grocery shopping day a week, and make healthy meals that you can freeze and eat later when you do not have time to cook."
},{
    barrier: "Not creative",

},{
    barrier: "Low energy",
    solution: "We all may feel low energy at times. But the irony is that creativity, rather than exhausting our energy, creative activities, exercise, and helping others will reverse a bad mood and actually GIVES us more energy. "
},{
    barrier: "Not worth it",
    solution: "When you are down and in a bad mood, it is easy to feel worthless. But, doing something to give you energy such as exercise, helping others, and creative fun activities will give you a positive feel.  And, if you do it with people who appreciate who you are, you will feel great again. "
},{
    barrier: "Don't know how to",
    solution: "Sign for up for a class on gardening, art, music, or cooking. You do not have to be an artist to be creative. Add a few buddies to share in the experience."
    },{
    barrier: "Not motivated",
    solution: "Think about your most important reasons for recovering and being healthy. For example, will it allow you to feel better, help your family, do things you love, and stop worrying about pain. Also, try being creative with different activities to stay interested."
    },{
    barrier: "Worried what others think",
    solution: "If you’re worried that others might judge you and your creative activities, then you need to overcome the social anxiety barrier by challenging negative thoughts – are people really judging you and even if they do, who cares?   Overcoming pain is far more important than what others think."
